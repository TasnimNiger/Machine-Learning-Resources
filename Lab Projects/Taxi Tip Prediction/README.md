# Faster Taxi Tip Prediction using Snap ML

In this lab, we will use machine learning (ML) modeling skills by a popular regression model: Decision Tree.  For this lab, useing the Snap ML library to accelerate popular Machine Learning algorithms through system awareness and hardware/software differentiation.

In this exercise we will practice not only the Scikit-Learn Python interface, but also the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy.
